LogLens — Root-Cause Log Explorer (Python)

A lightweight, SRE-focused tool for fast log exploration, anomaly detection, and healthy-vs-failing system comparison.
Built for real-world debugging workflows used in production environments.

🚀 Overview

LogLens helps engineers quickly understand what went wrong inside a distributed system by providing:

Fast log loading from JSONL or plain-text logs

Filtering (level, keyword, time range, request ID, latency)

Summaries (counts, top messages, latency percentiles)

Spike detection (minutes with abnormally high ERROR/WARN events)

Healthy vs failing diff (new messages, elevated frequency, latency deltas)

Use cases match real SRE + production support workflows, including:

✅ Incident response
✅ Root-cause analysis
✅ Latency investigations
✅ Debugging multi-service pipelines
✅ Reliability engineering exercises

🧠 Why I Built This

This project demonstrates my technical approach to reliability engineering:

Debugging distributed systems

Investigating event patterns + anomalies

Surfacing real signal from noisy logs

Structuring tools that support on-call workflows

Thinking like an SRE (observable systems, fast triage, clear root causes)

I built it as part of my SRE-track portfolio while applying for roles in production support, DevOps, and SRE, including Tesla's Software Support Engineer — Cell Software team.

📦 Features
✅ 1. Log Loading

Supports:

.jsonl with structured fields

Plain-text logs with timestamps and best-effort parsing

✅ 2. Advanced Filtering

Filter by:

Log level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, etc.)

Keywords

Request ID

Latency

Time window

✅ 3. Summaries at a Glance

Outputs:

Total log count

Distribution by level

Top normalized messages

Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)

Spike detection (WARN/ERROR activity)

✅ 4. Healthy vs Failing Diff

Shows:

New messages only appearing in the failing run

Messages whose frequency increased significantly

Latency shifts (p95 deltas)

Critical spike minutes in the failing system

Perfect for spotting regressions, outages, and service degradation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

Standard library only (no external deps)

Regex parsing, datetime handling, counters, dataclasses

Command-line interface using argparse

Works on macOS, Linux, Windows.

🧪 Sample Output

Summaries

Entries: 4231
By level: ERROR=189, WARN=321, INFO=3721
Top messages:
    -  134 × DB timeout <n>ms
    -   92 × Could not acquire lock <id>
Latency (ms): p50=82, p95=510, p99=1472
Spike minutes:
    - 2025-11-08T13:42Z : 22 events (baseline≈3.4x)


Diff

=== New Messages in FAILING ===
  -   42 × DB timeout <n>ms
  -   11 × state mismatch <id> vs <id>

=== Elevated Messages ===
  -  +24 × failed to write segment <id>

=== Latency ===
p95: healthy=410ms → failing=1270ms (Δ=860ms)

🎯 Future Improvements

Add structured JSON output for API/automation usage

Add mini web UI for interactive filtering

Add correlation by request_id across services

Add Grafana-style ASCII sparkline visualizations

Add noise suppression for noisy INFO logs

Allow reading rotated log directories
